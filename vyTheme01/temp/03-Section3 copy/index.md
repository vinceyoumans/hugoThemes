# Section 1. 
### Tim Schneider cashes 2 checks on Association Account for $13K.
Tim Schneider Defrauded the Association of $13K in two checks.

[Exh0001]({{< ref "/evidence/exh0001" >}} "Canceled checks for $13K")
{{< showButton01 linkTo="/evidence/exh0001" btnText="Exh001 - Canceled checks for $13K" Class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" >}}  





The Two Canceled checks include:

- Check 2475 - $8,271.75

        - Lambert Lawsuit Reimbursement

        - Note: Signed by Sylvia Snyder.

- Check 2398 - $5,591.30

        - Lambert Lawsuit Reimbursement
        
        - Note: Signed by Kelly Sheehan and Sylvia Snyder.

Checks are Reimbursement for Lambert v Schneider/CIW lawsuit.

The Evidence is discussed in more detail to follow.
In short... 

- Lambert Sues Schneider for Fraud

- Schneider retains attorney for Rent and Own Realestate

- Schneider reimburses himself from the association bank account.

- Sylvia Snyder and Kelly Sheehan signed check.


#### Significance:
The association was not made aware that TS was being sued as part of this lawsuit. We were led to believe that CIW was being sued and that TS was managing the case.
This payment is effectively using CIW Funds to subsidize TS Business as well as TS bad behavior.
 
**Lambert Prevailed and awarded $10,150.**

# Section 2.
### Sylvia Snyder, Treasurer is Sued by CIW to recover Financial Documents.

Sylvia Snyder, CIW Treasurer and Signer on ALL bank accounts, concealed Tim Schneider’s fraud from the rest of the BOD.
Evidence shows that...

- Sylvia Snyder refused to turn over financials after retiring as BOD Treasurer in 2018.  

- Coral Isle West filed suit and did not receive the Financials until December of 2019.

[Exh0400]({{< ref "/evidence/exh0400" >}} "Coral Isle West Association v Sylvia Snyder - case 2019-011855-CA-01")


I will also testify that while I was BOD member in 2016 and 2017, Sylvia Snyder 

- Routinely attacked my character.

- Routinely removed me from email chains while a BOD member.

- Several Occasions she retained the Association's attorney against me. In all cases based on hearsay and misinformation invented by her or another older woman, Asya Goslin. 

- In all cases it amounted to harassment. .

- In no case has she demonstrated proof of her allegations against me. 

- Claimed Health issues ( cancer ) whenever I asked to do a financial audit.

- In one case, She threatened to call the police on me for requesting to audit the financials, claiming that I threatened physical attack, which I would never do.

- Made it a holy jihad to reflexively sabotage anything I suggested or my agenda items.

It’s not clear what her behavior motivations were but I have three theories. 
 
#### Theory One
She is a 68 year old woman who has spent most of her years on the CIW BOD with cancer.  I respect her will to fight cancer, but I also feel that she should have retired upon announcing she was to have chemotherapy.  She was also working full time.  Signs of distress manifest as Paranoia, Depression, and clear Delusional disorder. She lectured for sympathy over her Dead Husband at almost every opportunity for an argument, especially when I asked her about condo finances. 
 
 
#### Theory Two
The second theory is that she is Extremely Offended that I, Vincent Youmans, was a member and President of the **Coral Isle West YACHT association LLC**, a separate entity from the CIW BOD. Membership of the CIWYA requires ownership in the CIW Condo Association as well as legal title to one of the boat slips.  More can be discussed later, but she and others have long been attempting to destroy the CIWYA, both legally and illegally. The agreement between CIWYA and CIWCA was made 40 years ago and they ( SSnyder, TSchneiber, Sheehan and several others)  do not approve of the terms. All objections are fabricated and never get past the threatening letter stage. There have been two lawsuites, CIWCA v CIWYA where the Defendant ( the Yacht Association ) prevailed in both situations.

The point being is that she clearly has a chip on her shoulders over the CIWYA. I was the Yacht Association President and she would never miss an opportunity to fabricate falsehoods and harass me personally.   Tim Schneider allied with her against the CIW Yacht association, and me personally, because he wanted to sell the Valuable Dock slips.  
 
 
#### Theory three
She was offended that I have been working to introduce new technology into the building as well as other innovations. My biggest initiative was to bring in broadband Internet that infuriated the older generation.  For example, She called a vendor, ATT, to tell them that I, Vincent Youmans, had no authority to carry on a conversation to bring in Broadband fiber. This happened after ATT had already done a survey of the building, submitted a proposal and I made a short presentation to Sylvia for her support.   
 
#### Theory Four.
She is just mean, unhappy and has no friends.  Tim Schnieder can appear to be very friendly and I think he just charmed her.
 
Further evidence, of at least 5 other situations,  is available upon request.  If I have time, I will be including them as evidence.  The point being that Sylvia Snyder, was not acting responsibly or in good faith.

 
 
#### additional Notes about Sylvia Snyder
Sylvia Snyder was sued to recover financial documents.  Unfortunately, the documents were never audited before the 2019 BOD agreed to settle the case against Sylvia.  After audit, the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 accounts seem fairly complete but I still had to make Bank record requests.  However, previous years are almost completely gone.  Everything pre 2014 is gone.  She should have protested the previous administration for accounts and books.

In addition, Sylvia Snyder only turned over paper financials. She did not turn over quick books electronic files.  

Another Suspicious behavior is that CIW rotated through Banks almost every 4 years.  I believe the reason for Switching from TDBank in 2018 to ValleyBank was an attempt to conceal previous financials. Prior banks seem to include BancoPopular and Atlantic in the past 5 years.  Sylvia Snyder, as Treasurer, was the point person for changing bank accounts.  There is no evidence that she sought approval in BOD minutes.


#### EDO holding CIW Funds in Escrow
There is also evidence to show that EDO, the attorney, was used to bank CIW funds. Sylvia mentions this in a BOD Minutes but never elaborates.  Because Sylvia did not deliver pre 2016 financials, there is no way to audit and confirm. Tim Schnieder was involved in the BOD those years. 

Alex Navaro, Unit 201, was treasurer in some of those years and made multiple accusations at the 2016 BOD meeting that $250K had disappeared, but never showed proof.   As Treasurer, I believe Sylvia Snyder should have demanded that previous BOD turn over financials, but she never brought it up in the BOD meetings.  I repeat that TS was President of the 2016 BOD and a friend of EDO. Because the records were lost, there is no way to audit the books.


#### Significance:
This case would have been referred for investigation much sooner had Sylvia Snyder presented the accounts sooner.  I would have made a formal Florida Statute 718.111(13) records request but Snyder, TS and JM had started another major problem in 2017, and Snyder was complaining of cancer so I granted her some mercy. At that point, I did not smell the conspiracy.  The issue at hand happened in 2015/2016, but the coverup continued until 2019, so I do not believe there is a statute of limitations issue.

# Section 3   Kelly Sheehan
## KS was not eligible to serve on BOD but was secretary and Signer on Bank Account.
Kelly Sheehan served as BOD Secretary, 2015, 2016, and 2018. However, he was not eligible to be a BOD member. 
 
[Exh0005]({{< ref "/evidence/exh0005" >}} "Details about Kelly Sheehanr")

Evidence will show that.

1. Kelly Sheehan resided in Unit 801.

2. KS served as BOD member, Secretary 2015, 2016 2018.

3. KS was a signer on Association Bank Accounts.

4. Unit 801 was titled to a Delaware Corporation that Sheehan had no relationship. 

5. KS was not eligible to serve as a BOD member, let alone, secretary or Bank Signer..

6. KS also signed one of the Checks for Tim Schneider.

I believe that Tim Schneider knew that Sheehan was not eligible to serve on the BOD. Because TS and KS had a common interest in damaging the CIWYA, TS did not OUT or Object to KS because KS was a trusted vote. This common interest detail can be entered into evidence upon request.

# Section 5
## Tim Schnieder was the owner and Broker for **RENT and OWN Realestate** and very active in the Building.


#### RENT and OWN Brokerage Inc.

# Section 6
## Lambert Accusations 
The Accusation made in the **Lambert v Schneider**  LawSuit was that Schnieder gave preferential treatment to his customers and clients.  I will attest that Tim Schnieder was the keeper of the official “Rental Waiting List” and single source of truth.  I can Attest to this because I asked TS who mainted the list. TS said that that he maintained the list, but Asya Goslin was doing screenings.

**  Add Link to Law suite ** 


To demonstrate that TS was active in the building, evidence will show extensive Background checks of Buyers and renters discovered in the recovered financial files delivered by SSnyder. TS hid his activity in doing BackGround checks on new Buyers and Renters by hiding his identity on invoices that he would bill the Association.  He used the name of his “Friend” Richard Brigham, who did live in the building with Tim in Unit 907 until his death. 



[Exh0225]({{< ref "/exh0225" >}} "RBrigham - Background Checks")
 
The owner of the unit 907, that is listed by Brigham, is actually owned by Tim Schnieder.


[Exh0205]({{< ref "evidence/exh0205" >}} "Tax Record for unit 907")
 

But Richard Brigham was an old man, retired, in a wheel chair and Technically not qualified to turn a computer on.  He has since passed away.    

 

## Significance
It shows that... 

1. TS and RENT and OWN real estate was very involved in the brokerage and renting of CIW units.

2. It supports the accusation that TS was controlling the Rental list, which gave him the ability to move his customers to the front of line as was alleged in the Lambert Law suite.

3. It shows that TS was concealing and subsidizing, his business activity with CIW funds.

4. There is no evidence that TS actually did the credit checks.
 
### Note.
I am also suspicious that TS charged the CIWCA for these back ground checks but never actually did them.  I have nver seen any Background check in all the years I was on the BOD. He invoiced CIWCA via Email which might be a violation as well.  This might be an interesting angle as well.

# Section 7
The Lambert Law Suite


[Exh0300]({{< ref "/evidence/exh0300" >}} "LAW SUIT - Lambert v Rent and Own")


CIW is listed as a defendant solely because Tim Schneider was President of the BOD for CIW.
Evidence shows that Lambert was primarily suing TS and his Brokerage,  But **TS, acting as president of CIW, intentionally sabotaged the defence of CIW to protect his own company.**

## Lambert, The Plaintiff prevailed
Evidence will show that Lambert prevailed in Lambert v Schneider, thus there was grounds for the suite. However, to repeat, CIW was named as a “Nominal” Defendant and specifically states that the illicit behavior was by Tim Schnieder.  

The Plaintiff was awarded $10K, paid by CIW insurance company. 
Rent and Own Realestate, and Tim Schneider were held harmless.  How could this have happened?  Because... 

1. Schneider was managing the Defence of CIW in secret 

2. Schneider was telling lies to BOD members requesting status. Specifically Myself.

3. Schneider was actually sabotaging the CIW defence so as to protect his own personal interests.
 
My personal suspicion, based on timeline and behavior pattern, was that Schnieder made a deal with Lambert under the table. In exchange for a guilty plea by CIW, Lambert would agree to forgive Rent and Own.  Lambert Accepted the terms which included a settlement of $10K paid by CIW Insurance. This settlement was never brought up at a CIW BOD meeting. As a BOD member at the time, I was never made aware of this agreement, however, Tim Schnieder did tell me, off record, that the case had been settled and that Lambert Lost, which I now know was a lie.
 
## Intentional Insurance Fraud
Evidence will also show that Tim Schneider intentionally committed Insurance Fraud by causing CIW Insurance to pay $10K in damages to Lambert.


Tim Schnieder, at the very least, should have disclosed his conflict of interest. Better solution would have been for Tim Schnieder to have recused himself from the CIW part of the suit so that a non conflicted BOD member could manage the Lambert case. That said, if Tim Schnieder had recused himself and permitted another BOD member to manage the lawsuit, such as myself, then CIW would probably have been held harmless and dismissed from the suit completely.  Rent and Own Realestate would probably have been found liable.
 
In short, Tim Schnieder used the Coral Isle West Association, a non profit of which he was the president with a Fiduciary responsibility, to subsidize his personal business and to immunize his behavior.

# Section 8
## George Lambert resigns from BOD
George Lambert was a BOD member for 2015 and 2016.
He resigned, apparently voluntarily during the lawsuit, but the terms were never discussed at a BOD meeting or casually in emails.


[Exh0300]({{< ref "/evidence/exh0230" >}} "LAW SUIT - Lambert v Rent and Own")


---
# Section 9
## Schneider uses $13,000 of Condo Association funds to Fund HIs personal Defence
Tim Schnieder used billable Association attorney hours, EDO.  It is not clear what benefit to the condo association, but neither Rent and Own or TS has repaid the Association for EDO's fees.

[Exh0220]({{< ref "evidence/exh0220" >}} "Schneider used EDO, Association Attorney, to sabotage Association defence.")
 
NOTE:  I have not made a request for information from EDO yet, but I know what to ask for.  I am certain that EDO will resist again which will spark another Florida Bar Request. This information will probably be actionable.
 


---
# Section 10

Schneider never willingly shared updates with me personally.  When I asked for updates, he would lie by telling me that Lambert was a very bad attorney, show me that Lambert had been disbarred in NY. He would conclude that everything would be dismissed and it was not worth paying attention.  I was more focused on another project.

But I did expect to get trusted updates at BOD meetings.  TS and SS lied at the BOD meeting which is documented in BOD meeting minutes.


[Exh0210]({{< ref "evidence/exh0210" >}} "BOD Minutes")



This Evidence also discusses APT 503.  This is interesting because Mr. Chapik is my Neighboor. I am in Unit 501.  Mr. Chapik had an illegal renter ( he claimed it was his God Daughter or something similar ), but she left unexpectedly.  He moved another renter in, claiming that TS and Asha Goslin had given him permission.  This was excelated to the BOD meeting where he argued why he should be permitted to rent off list. I remember the argument well. It was exactly what he claimed outside the BOD meeting. The meeting minutes state that Mr. Chapik would be updated in a letter, but he was permitted to rent off list.  Interesting.

TS denied giving him permission to rent off list, but then Mr. Chapik was not TS's client.


---
# Section 11
## Consequences for Schnieder behavior.
Tim Schneider’s behavior caused harm to the Association he had a fiduciary responsibility to protect.


## Insurance. 
Because of the Loss activity, the CIW Insurance carrier dropped coverage for 2021. The Lambert case was one of the largest items.  The association has since found a new carrier but the premiums are $40,000 more than in 2017.

In addition, CIW is now in a state of Insurance probation. If we, CIW, incur another lawsuit, regardless of verdict, CIW is at risk of losing the carrier.

TS has also set a new policy that effectively allows the BOD to ignore rules and Regulations that limit renters to 15% of all units.  This behavior has been gradually changed back to following the rules but not without awkward situations.

# Section 12
Back to the first two checks for $13K.  
These checks were to cover the misbehavior of Tim Schnieder. 
Evidence will show that:

 1. The BOD never voted to pay these checks.

 2. Tim Schnieder only shared the invoice with trusted member Snyder.

 3. Schnieder fabricated an invoice for payment that includes false statements.

 4. Schneider conspired with Sylvia Snyder and Kelly Sheehan in a conspiracy to defraud the association.
 
Had I been made aware of Schneider’s actions, I would have objected. 
It may well be possible to show that Schnieder used Email to send false statements, which may also be a violation of some statute involving mail.

# Conclusion

1. TS, working as a Broker, Commits Fraud.
 
2. His Client, George Lambert, sues both TS, Rent and Own Inc, and CIW.

3. CIW was named as a nominal defendant but included because TS was President of the Association.

4. TS, despite having a clear conflict of interest, single handedlly manages the Law suite as well as CIW interests.  He also refuses to share information with other BOD members.

5. TS sabatages the Defence of CIW. CIW is found liable for TS behavior as Broker Owner of Rent and Own Brokerage Inc. Lambert is awarded $10,000

6. Schneider Embezzels $13,000 from CIW Bank account to pay for His personal and Business Law firm.  There is no evidence of requesting permission from the BOD.

7. He was assisted by 
 - Sylvia Snyder, Treasurer.
 - Kelly Sheehan, Secretary, who was on the BOD illegally.

8. TS also committed Insurance Fraud and caused the DandO policy to not be renewed due to activity.

9. TS also used the services of Condo Association Attorney, EDO, for aprox $1K, although EDO seems to have cooperated by ignoring the behavior.

TS should return 

a. $10K for settlement 
b. $13K for Attorney
c. $1K to repay EDO behavior.


I intentionally limited evidence to this specific complaint. That said, I am preparing a second complaint, with the same cast of characters.  I consider the second complaint far more serious.
 
This document is a work in progress. I will do my best to improve the presentation and add additional evidence.
That said, I am also prepared to testify under oath as a first person witness.


Sincerely
Vincent youmans
